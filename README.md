# MediaDock
This is a light-weight application to control audio playback on Windows.

# Roadmap

* Previous/Next
* Volume Control
* Window always on top

# Additional Features
Extra features that would be nice for MediaDock to have:
* Save/Load settings to/from a file
* Background selection
* Toggle always on top

# Installation Instructions
This application is still in development and doesn't have instructions yet.
